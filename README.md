# Writing and publishing online surveys in RShiny
An example of an online survey (about baked goods) written in RShiny. It is designed to be published as a shiny app, with the submitted data stored using google sheets. See the file `app.R` to start. 

There is also a demo (AudioRatingDemo.R) for how to run a similar experiment but with audio files instead of images, and with a rating question instead of a multiple choice question. And there's a demo of how to do the same thing but with videos (VideoRatingDemo.R) and ratings.
