# ShinySurvey
An example of an online survey (about baked goods) written in RShiny. It is designed to be published as a shiny app, with the submitted data stored using google sheets. You can see the published app [here](https://bonnie-mclean.shinyapps.io/BakedGoodsSurvey/).

There is also a demo (AudioRatingDemo.R) for how to run a similar experiment but with audio files instead of images, and with a rating question instead of a multiple choice question.
