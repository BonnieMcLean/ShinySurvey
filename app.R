### !!!! IMPORTANT !!!!! ###
## This code won't run properly for you until you authorise it to access your google account,
## and make a google sheets that it can write the submissions to.

### HOW TO DO THIS

# first, you will need to install and load the following packages (shiny already comes with R)

library(shiny)
library(shinyjs)
library(googlesheets4)
library(googledrive)

# These first few bits of code (making the google sheet, authorising the account), only need to be run once, 
# so they are commented out now. Just uncomment them and run them once the first time you set up your app, then 
# comment them out again once you deploy it.

## 1. SET UP AUTHORISATION TO EDIT FILES IN YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE

# Get the token and store it in a cache folder embedded in your app directory
# designate project-specific cache

options(gargle_oauth_cache = ".secrets")

# The line below (drive_auth()) is used to authenticate your google account. Uncomment it and run the app ONCE, then check if the token 
# has been stored inside the .secrets folder, after that just comment out the line again (or it will ask you to sign in every time you run the app)

# drive_auth() # Authenticate to produce the token in the cache folder

# Tell gargle to search the token in the secrets folder and to look
# for an auth given to a certain email (enter your email linked to googledrive!)

drive_auth(cache = ".secrets", email = "YOUREMAIL@gmail.com")
gs4_auth(token = drive_token())

## 2. Make google sheet

# You only need to make the google sheet once, so uncomment the line below and run it in your console to make the google sheet, then comment it out again

# ss <- gs4_create("SurveyData")

# Run the code below in your console to get the sheet ID

# ss[1]

# Copy and paste the sheet ID from the console, storing it in the variable sheet_ID (replace the XXXXXXs here with your sheet ID)

sheet_ID <- "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Congratulations, now this shiny app will be able to write to your google sheet!

### CODE FOR THE APP ITSELF

# Make a vector to store the image links
